# This is my logbook for my data recording for Resolution calculation

## Part 1
---
- For all the simulation in this part I use the structure 
    - Number of particles - 50,000
    - charge (-1)
    - mass -  single value - 10
    - source position - spherical distribution - center(23,80,80) radius(1)
    - Azimuth (0) , Elevation (0)
    - KE (3)
    - Lens 1,2,3,4 and flight tube voltage (300 V)

### TOF110.txt
- pusher voltage -10V
- The histogram is given as

- And for the Gaussian fit the fit parametes and Resolution is 
```text

```

### TOF120.txt
- pusher voltage -20V
- The histogram is given as
