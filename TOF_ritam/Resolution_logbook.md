# This is my logbook for my data recording for Resolution calculation

## Part 1
---
- For all the simulation in this part I use the structure 
    - Number of particles - 50,000
    - charge (-1)
    - mass -  single value - 10
    - source position - gaussian3d distribution - mean(23,80,80) std(1,1,1)
    - Azimuth (0) , Elevation (0)
    - KE (3)
    - Lens 1,2,3,4 and flight tube voltage (300 V)
